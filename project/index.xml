&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..0VC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;span style="color:blue">Chung et al. 2014&lt;/span>&lt;/a>) is a new &lt;strong>multi-Integral Field Unit (multi-IFU)&lt;/strong> instrument planned to be mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal optical telescope (
&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SPIE.8444E..1TS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;span style="color:blue">Sagar et al. 2012&lt;/span>&lt;/a>)(
&lt;a href="https://www.aries.res.in/dot/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link 1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.aries.res.in/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link 2&lt;/a>) in Nainital, India. DOTIFS has &lt;strong>16 deployable IFUs&lt;/strong> covering an &lt;strong>8 arcminute&lt;/strong> diameter field of view. Each IFU covers &lt;strong>8.7 arcsec x 7.4 arcsec&lt;/strong> on the sky, and is composed of a 12 x 12 array of hexagonal shape microlenses each of which is &lt;strong>0.8 arcsec&lt;/strong> vertex to vertex. Use of microlens array allows ~99% fill factor. Optical fibers are attached at the back side of each microlens to gather and transfer light to the spectrographs. The fibers form a pseudoslit at the entrance of spectrograph. Dispersion is achieved using fixed Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) grating. Wavelength coverage is &lt;strong>370-740nm&lt;/strong>, and the spectral resolution is &lt;strong>1200 – 2400&lt;/strong> over the wavelength range. DOTIFS have eight identical spectrographs to cover 2,304 fibers, with 288 fibers (from two IFUs) per spectrograph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://instru.iucaa.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instrumentation group&lt;/a> at the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune, India) is leading this project. Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (Nainital, India) is operating the Devasthal telescope, and Korea Institute for Advanced Study and Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea) are participating as international collaborators. The scientific goals are focused on nearby galaxies, which are the primary targets of the instrument. This includes rotation curves of nearby galaxies, galactic HII regions, and merging/interacting galaxies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are developing the instrument with 4 IFUs and 2 spectrographs in the first stage. After the initial commissioning on the telescope, we will add 12 IFUs and 6 spectrographs to complete the instrument in the second stage. Currently, DOTIFS is in the assembly, integration and testing phase of its first stage. We expect to commission the instrument in the middle of 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I joined this project when I entered the graduate school in Fall 2012, when there was only one science requirement document about this project. Since then I learned about astronomical instrumentation both the general picture of the development and the specific details. As a member of DOTIFS team, I mainly contributed to the overall conceptual design, optical design, and software development. I describe details of my contribution as below.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Overall conceptual design&lt;br>
I have performed &lt;strong>a conceptual design study&lt;/strong> of the instrument in the early stage of the project. I proposed feasible design which fulfills all the demands from science requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optical design&lt;br>
I have designed &lt;strong>the optical systems&lt;/strong> in the instrument (Spectrograph collimator and camera, fore-optics, and calibration optics). I am using &lt;strong>ZEMAX&lt;/strong> to optimize the optical layouts from an existing design or scratch to meet the requirements. I performed &lt;strong>tolerance analysis&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>thermal analysis&lt;/strong> with ZEMAX and suggested a solution to mitigate the impact of temperature variation to the optical performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Software&lt;br>
I have developed a &lt;strong>spectrograph CCD image simulator&lt;/strong> (in C/C++ and IDL) and an &lt;strong>exposure time calculator (ETC)&lt;/strong> (in IDL and Python3). The spectrograph CCD image simulator utilizes information of varying PSF shape on the image plane from ZEMAX, and throughput of intermediate components between a target and CCD. It generates simulated CCD image in the unit of the electron. Currently, I am developing a &lt;strong>data reduction pipeline&lt;/strong> (in Python3) using the output of the CCD image simulator. The exposure time calculator calculates expected S/N ratio of the spectrum from a given target.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/astrohchung/dotifsetc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Command line version DOTIFS ETC in Python3&lt;/a> is available through Github. The web version of DOTIFS ETC will be developed shortly using a Python web framework such as
&lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flask&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to the above contributions, I am &lt;strong>organizing the regular development telecon&lt;/strong> and circulating the minutes weekly. During a telecon, each member updates the current progress of the development on every subpart of the instrument, and discuss issues and suggest a solution. I also &lt;strong>have performed various laboratory testing on parts&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>produced necessary documents&lt;/strong> for the project. I will visit IUCAA this year (2018) and be involved in an instrument assembly, integration and test.&lt;/p>

We perform a PSF deconvolution on the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field unit (IFU) data to mitigate beam-smearing and atmospheric seeing effect. We use wavelength-dependent PSF size information to perform the deconvolution. We test the PSF deconvolution method to the mock IFU data and show that the deconvolved IFS data by this method can reasonably well recover correct kinematic parameters. Deconvolution performance is depending on radial coverage and S/N distribution of an IFS data. The method can be applied to other type of IFU data as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Manuscript work in progress. Will be submitted to refereed Journal by July 2020&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Python3 code can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/astrohchung/deconv">https://github.com/astrohchung/deconv&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Light from the sky to a ground-based telescope always pass through the atmosphere, and turbulence of the atmosphere blurs light from a point source to the shape of a point spread function (PSF), which called as atmospheric seeing effect. This effect correlates spatial information of extended objects and limits a detailed spatially resolved study of the objects. There are ways to overcome this seeing effect using 1) space telescope, or 2) adaptive optics but, the resources are limited. Thus, most of ground-based telescopes are still being suffered by the seeing effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the field of fiber-based integral field spectroscopy, the situation becomes worse due to the large sampling size of the fibers. In case of

&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...798....7B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;span style="color:blue">(Bundy et al. 2015)&lt;/span>&lt;/a>, the fiber sampling size causes undersampling of the astronomical targets and produces effective PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) with about 2.5&amp;rdquo;. This is larger than typical atmospheric seeing size (1.5&amp;rdquo;)
&lt;a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/manga-survey-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(ref)&lt;/a> at the Apache point observatory. Although MaNGA made a set of three dithered exposure to relieve the undersampling issue, the effect of seeing and beam-smearing remain in the reduced data. For example, in case of SDSS-IV MaNGA data, the direct comparison of &lt;i>gri&lt;/i> image from SDSS imaging camera and reconstructed &lt;i>gri&lt;/i> image from MaNGA IFU shows the difference in image quality due to sampling size. Here we call combined effect of seeing and beam-smearing as a PSF effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There were many attempts to minimize impacts of the PSF effect on their scientific results. An approach is convolving a PSF on a model before comparing with observed data. Another approach is estimating an impact of seeing on the derived parameter by forward modeling. By using forward modeling, it is possible to find a relation between PSF size with a paticular measured parameter. (See
&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477.4711G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;span style="color:blue">Graham et al. 2018&lt;/span>&lt;/a> for spin parameter measurement) However, the first approach requires PSF convolution on each model and the second approach requires forward modeling on each parameter, both demand a considerable computational power and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We propose a new method to mitigate the PSF effect on IFU data using &lt;strong>PSF deconvolution&lt;/strong>. This method deconvolves the IFU data at each wavelength bin using gaussian shape PSF. It applies Richardson–Lucy algorithm
&lt;a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-62-1-55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;span style="color:blue">(Richardson 1972)&lt;/span>&lt;/a> and deconvolves the IFU data at each wavelength bin using a gaussian shape PSF. In case of MaNGA IFU data, FWHM of PSF at four bands (&lt;i>griz&lt;/i>) are used to define the gaussian shape PSF. FWHM values are provided along with an each IFU data from observation of stars with 12 mini-IFUs (7 fibers). By applying this method, we have found that PSF-deconvolved data shows noticable difference compared with PSF-convolved data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We performed comprehensive tests to quantitatively check the effect of our method. &lt;strong>We construct a PSF-free mock of MaNGA IFU data&lt;/strong> using a set of geometrical parameter, light distribution, signal to noise ratio distribution, stellar kinematic model, and synthetic stellar population. From a set of PSF-free mock, we produce PSF-convolved mock data by convolving wavelength dependent gaussian PSF and adding Poisson noise. We apply our deconvolution method to the PSF-convolved mock data and generate PSF-deconvolved mock IFU data. We measure kinematic model parameters from three different kinds of mock IFU data (PSF-free, PSF-convolved, and PSF-deconvolved), and compare them with each other. The result shows that &lt;strong>the kinematics parameters measured from PSF-deconvolved mock IFU data is well-matched with those from PSF-free mock IFU data,&lt;/strong> while those from PSF-convolved mock data are not. &lt;strong>We conclude that the PSF deconvolution method is an efficient way to convert PSF-convolved data close to PSF-Free one.&lt;/strong> Outcome of this method can be used directly for comparison with a model or measurement of a certain parameter, without an additional process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to demonstrate the validity of the deconvolution method quantitatively and estimate the limitation of this method, we are performing additional tests with the mock MaNGA IFU data. We are expected to apply this method for general data analysis of integral field spectroscopy. &lt;strong>The deconvolution code in Python3 will be publicly available soon through Github with a tutorial.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

(top) Each column shows an example of the different distribution of kinematic parameters generating mock MaNGA IFU data. The first and second columns imply varying kinematic distribution depending on $r_1$ and $1/r_2$. $r_1$ and $1/r_2$ are rotation curve model parameters of an equation on this figure. From the third to fifth columns, these are varying intensity distribution, depends on Sersic index, effective radius, and inclination angle. The last one means varying S/N distribution. (bottom) This is the velocity distribution measured from three different kinds of mock MaNGA IFU data.

We perform PSF deconvolution on the 3D Cube to overcome the atmospheric seeing and the beam-smearing effect. Using 2D stellar velocity maps measured from the deconvolved cubes, we fit a simple thin-disk rotation curve model (a hyperbolic tangent function with a linear term) to obtain model parameters and kinematic geometry of the galaxies. The PSF deconvolution is crucial to study the detail of the rotation curve. We notice that galaxies with disk show clear rigid body rotation around the center and flat rotation at their outskirts, but also show inclined rotation curve (decreasing/increasing) at their outskirts as well, depending on galaxy morphology (Early/Late). Rotation curve model parameters (rotation velocity amplitude, inner specific radius, and outskirt curve slope) are correlated with mass, for both early and late-type galaxies. For low mass (log(M_star/M_sun) &amp;lt; 10) late-type galaxies, their rotation curve slope at the outskirt have a positive correlation when the large-scale (background mass density from 20 nearest galaxies) or the small scale (projected distance to the nearest neighbor galaxies) environmental parameters are larger than the mean cosmic mass density or smaller than one virial radius of the nearest neighbor galaxy. These results suggest that both the large and small scale environmental parameters play a considerable effect on stellar kinematics.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We deconvolved MaNGA 3D cube data to mitigate the effect of large PSF size.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The deconvolution procedure is crucial to recovering true RC model parameters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MaNGA rotation curve is parametrized by a fitting model function.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rotation curve slope at galaxy outskirts radius shows correlation with large/small scale environment parameter at fixed stellar mass, especially when R_n/r_vri,n&amp;lt;1 and $\rho$_20/&amp;lt;ρ&amp;gt; &amp;gt;1.&lt;/li>
